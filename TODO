- Simulate one plate with beam and plasma
-- Define Plane class
-- Properties: 

- Generate particles for plasma divertor
-- readDivertedParameters (2D symmetric): 
--- Computation: number_of_particles
--- Magnetic: Br, Bz, Bphi, 
--- Interface (particle generation surface): SPx, SPz, angle, 
--- Plasma parameters: SOLpower, lambda_q, S, fx
-- createDivertedParticles:
--- Energy of particles defined by SOLpower and number of particles
--- Density of particles defined by the power density radial function
--- Divergence of particles defined by the magnetic properties
